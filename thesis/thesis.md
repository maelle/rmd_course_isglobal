Write your thesis with RMarkdown?
==================================

* Like LaTeX but easier. Smaller file, less crashing, less corruption issues.

* Reproducibility of your thesis.

* Cross-references.

* Equations with LaTeX if needed.

* Use [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), and look at [this repo](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) with a template for a thesis. [This blog post](http://seankross.com/bookdown-start/) is also a nice introduction to `bookdown`.

* Learn RMarkdown with smaller documents before!
