Slides with RMarkdown
=====================

* A few different frameworks. Pdf, html5.

* Let's try `reveal.js`! See [thewebsite](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/revealjs_presentation_format.html). Cool options include navigation, slides backgrounds.

* What about the corporate first and last slides? Use Beamer output + pdf of first and last slides, paste pdf via the `tabulizer` package (`merge_pdfs` function) in a makefile. Or we can create an ISGlobal css? Not too hard. See [R-Ladies `reveal.js` style](https://github.com/rladies/resources/tree/master/revealjs)
