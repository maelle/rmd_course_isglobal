===============================

* Use `rmdTemplates` for getting a template.

* Look at the template. Figures and tables at the end.

* How to do your own template, also do you really need one?

* Discuss organization of the folder. data folder, code folder, etc. Don't let it become a mess!

* `ezknitr` but html only.

* citations, look at the YAML of the template. .bib from Mendeley ([this link](https://blog.mendeley.com/2011/10/25/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/). How to insert a citation without any help, how to use `knitcitations`, how to use `citr`. 

* Collaboration.
