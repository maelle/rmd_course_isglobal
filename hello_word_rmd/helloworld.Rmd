## R Markdown {#rmd}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Also see [section 1](#rmd)

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Section 1

## Subsection 1

Hey this _italic_ and this is **bold**.

In our study we have `r nrow(cars)` patients.

I want to make a list!

* One thing

* Another one

```{r nice table}
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

# Broom!

```{r broom}
library("broom")
model <- lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)
knitr::kable(glance(model))
```


```{r plot large, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 15}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r plot square, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
plot(pressure)
```
