RMarkdown basics
================

* Let's look at the default document we get when creating a RMarkdown. YAML front matter, put today's date and your name.

* Chunks vs. text.

* Knit for the first time.

* Knit in a different output format.

* Options, in particular echo, and options for all chunks in a set-up chunk.

* Inline code. 

* Text structure via headers, text style *italic* and **bold**, itemize.

* Table of contents.

* Cross-references

* Why to name the chunks and keep them short: navigation, debugging.

* Also keep code lines short, it's good in general but even more so when you're printing code.

* Pretty tables. `kable`, and then one can explore `pander` and `stargazer`.

* Regression results with `broom`.

* Figure options. When changing size, it might be useful to change text size on the figure.

* Caching.

* End by distributing the RMarkdown cheatsheet.
